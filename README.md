# 3D-modeling
Development of a 3D model generator using kinect for further use as training for object recognition

Several programs will be contained on this repository with the objective of setting up the system, a filtering program will be created as well as a grabber system with which to work, both work ok so later programs should include a program which takes saved files generated with the grabber for merging.


If any filtering modifications are done please also modify the object grabber parameters.
